test 1 - Console log has confirmed that our buttons are functional and respond to clicks.

7:08 PM
test 2 - Changed score identifier to an id attribute and now the +1 button adds 1 to the scoreboard. I will now do the same for the other buttons that will increased the score by 2 and 3 for each team's score.
